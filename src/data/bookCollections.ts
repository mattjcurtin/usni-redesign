/**
 * Book collections — the shared content model behind every Books & Press
 * "collection" page: the imprint's named series, the Blue & Gold / Scarlet &
 * Gold professional libraries, and the military reading lists.
 *
 * These pages are all the same shape on the live site: a block of custom
 * WYSIWIG introduction copy followed by a bibliography of the titles in the
 * collection. The redesign turns that shape into one template
 * (`CollectionIntro` + `CollectionTitlesGrid`, composed by `BookCollectionPage`)
 * so the Press can stand up a new collection — a promotional set like "Books
 * About Submarines", or an evergreen one like a Commandant's Reading List — by
 * adding an entry here rather than hand-building another page.
 *
 * Copy, titles, prices, formats, and cover art are transcribed from the live
 * Drupal site (test-usni3.pantheonsite.io) as of September 2026. Titles the
 * live site lists without a product link are carried here with no `href`; see
 * `project-references/books-press-collections-link-audit.md` for the full
 * list, plus the links that are outright broken and need content fixes before
 * go-live.

  about: [
    'This series is designed to explore previously ignored facets of the history of airpower. It includes a wide variety of disciplinary approaches, scholarly perspectives, and argumentative styles. Its fundamental goal is to analyze the past, present, and potential future utility of airpower and to enhance our understanding of the changing roles played by aerial assets in the formulation and execution of national military strategies. It encompasses the incredibly diverse roles played by airpower, which include but are not limited to efforts to achieve air superiority; strategic attack; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions; airlift operations; close-air support; and more. Of course, airpower does not exist in a vacuum. There are myriad terrestrial support operations required to make airpower functional, and examinations of these missions is also a goal of this series.',
    'In less than a century, airpower developed from flights measured in minutes to the ability to circumnavigate the globe without landing. Airpower has become the military tool of choice for rapid responses to enemy activity, the primary deterrent to aggression by peer competitors, and a key enabler to military missions on the land and sea. This series provides an opportunity to examine many of the key issues associated with its usage in the past and present, and to influence its development for the future.',

    'The fundamental transformations in warfare — revolutions in military affairs, and the ideas, devices, and doctrines that permanently changed how wars are fought.',
  hero: { variant: 'light' },
  about: [
    'To ensure success, the conduct of war requires rapid and effective adaptation to changing circumstances. While every conflict involves a degree of flexibility and innovation, there are certain changes that have occurred throughout history that stand out because they fundamentally altered the conduct of warfare. The most prominent of these changes have been labeled “Revolutions in Military Affairs” (RMAs). These so-called revolutions include technological innovations as well as entirely new approaches to strategy. Revolutionary ideas in military theory, doctrine, and operations have also permanently changed the methods, means, and objectives of warfare.',
    'This series examines fundamental transformations that have occurred in warfare. It places particular emphasis upon RMAs to examine how the development of a new idea or device can alter not only the conduct of wars but their effect upon participants, supporters, and uninvolved parties. The unifying concept of the series is not geographical or temporal; rather, it is the notion of change in conflict and its subsequent impact. This has allowed the incorporation of a wide variety of scholars, approaches, disciplines, and conclusions to be brought under the umbrella of the series. The works include biographies, examinations of transformative events, and analyses of key technological innovations that provide a greater understanding of how and why modern conflict is carried out, and how it may change the battlefields of the future.',
