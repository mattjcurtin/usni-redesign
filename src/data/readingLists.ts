/**
 * Military reading lists — the service chiefs' professional reading programs,
 * and which Naval Institute Press titles appear on each.
 *
 * The live page (/press/military-reading-lists) is a stack of nine hand-edited
 * promo blocks. Four of the nine carry no Press titles at all ("None listed at
 * this time"), and two of them — Blue & Gold and Scarlet & Gold — simply repeat
 * the bibliographies that already live on their own series pages. The redesign
 * splits those into three groups so the page leads with the lists that actually
 * carry Press books:
 *
 *   1. `serviceLists` — a list with Press titles on it, rendered in full.
 *   2. `crossLinkedSeries` — the Press's own professional libraries, shown as a
 *      cross-link to the series page rather than a second copy of the list.
 *   3. `emptyLists` — a list with no Press titles yet, collapsed into a compact
 *      row of outbound links instead of nine-tenths of a page of empty section.
 *
 * Every external CTA below is transcribed from the live page. Several could not
 * be verified — see `project-references/books-press-collections-link-audit.md`;
 * the .mil hosts block automated requests, and some of the quoted copy is
 * visibly out of date.
